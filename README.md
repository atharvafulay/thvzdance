This website is meant to give visitors an idea of who I am and what I am involved in. It is meant to show my projects as well as my portfolio.

This website is based off one of the Bootstrap defaults. See [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for more detail. 

Everything after the inital setup was done by Atharva Fulay.
